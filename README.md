## IR GENERAL PRINCIPALS

### BASIC BLOCKS PRINCIPALS

- Basic block is a sequence of instructions
which can only be entered at the beginning
and exited at the end  
- Each basic block has only zero, one or two successors  
- Each basic block has any number of predecessors
- Method always starts with "start" basic block
- Method always ends with "return" basic block
- Method can have any number of basic blocks

### IR INSTRUCTION PRINCIPALS

- Each instruction has unique id in basic block
- Each instruction has zero or more input instructions
- Each instruction has zero or more user instructions

## IR INSTRUCTIONS TYPES AND DUMP SYNTAX

### PARAM INSTRUCTION

Read a parameter with given id and type from method  
``` 1.u32 param 0 ```

### CONSTANT INSTRUCTION  

Return a constant value of given type  
``` 2.u64 const 42 ```

### CAST INSTRUCTION

Cast input from other instruction from one given type to another
``` 3.u32 cast v2 ```

### BINARY OPERATIONS INSTRUCTIONS

Calculate result of given operation between two input instructions  
``` 4.u32 add v1 v3 ```  
``` 4.u32 sub v1 v3 ```  
``` 4.u32 mul v1 v3 ```  
``` 4.u32 div v1 v3 ```  

### RETURN INSTRUCTION

Return value from method  
``` 5.u32 return v1 ```

### CALL INSTRUCTION

Call method with given id and pass given parameters
and return value from method  
``` 6.u32 call v2 v3 v4 ```  
v2 - method id  
v3, v4 - parameters from input instructions  

### JUMP INSTRUCTION

Jump to instruction with given id  
``` 7 jump v2 ```

### IF INSTRUCTION

Compare two input values and if condition is true  
go to first successor basic block  
else go to second successor basic block  
``` 8 if.gt v1 v3 ```  
if flags:  
gt, lt, ge, le, eq, ne

### PHI INSTRUCTION

Merge any number of input values from predecessors basic blocks and return one value  
``` 9.u32 phi v1 v3 ```  
input values from predecessors basic blocks
goes in order same as order
of predecessors basic blocks
